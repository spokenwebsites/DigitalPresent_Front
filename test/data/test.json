In it, she travels the non-linear path of addiction to recovery, how it shifts over time, and what happens when it is translated through poetry. Looking beyond the straightforward, happily-ever-after narrative, Murakami wades through the aftermath of her addiction and questions what happens to trauma when it is put down on the page - and all the ways in which it can be rendered.\nIn The Gospel of Breaking, Jillian Christmas extracts from family history, queer lineage, and the political landscape of a racialized life to create a rich, softly defiant collection of poems.\nChristmas draws a circle around the things she calls \"holy\": the family line that cannot find its root but survived to fill the skies with radiant flesh; the body, broken and unbroken and broken and new again; the lover lost, the friend lost, and the loss itself; and the hands that hold them all with brilliant, tender care.\nABOUT THE POETS\nJillian Christmas is the former Artistic Director of Vancouver's Verses Festival of Words. An educator, organizer, and advocate in the arts community, utilizing an anti-oppressive lens, Jillian has performed and facilitated workshops across North America. She lives in Vancouver.\nSachiko Murakami is the author of three previous poetry collections, including The Invisibility Exhibit (shortlisted for the Governor General's Literary Award). As a literary worker, she has edited poetry, worked for trade organizations, hosted reading series, organized conferences, sat on juries, and judged prizes."

In 1971, Lawrence Ferlinghetti published them in the first edition of Revolutionary Letters as Number 27 in the City Lights Pocket Poets Series. By turns a handbook of countercultural activity and a broadside against the repressive state apparatus, Revolutionary Letters remains one of the vital classics of American poetry.\nIn gathering writers from all over the world to share in reading this work, it is our hope to honour Diane Di Prima and, through reading, activate and absorb the important instructions and revelations she left us in these letters.\n\n?????????????\nThis event will be live captioned using Google Meet hardware. A PDF copy of the poems will be emailed to all registered attendees prior to the event, and a link to a PDF will be provided in the chat at the beginning of the reading. We will read 63 Revolutionary Letters together in varying length, which we project will take upwards of two hours to complete. We welcome you to email us at info@metatron-press.com if you have any further requests!\n\n?????????\nAd\u00e8le Barclay\nAlasdair Rees\nAlex Manley\nAli Pinkney\nAshley Obscura\nBara Hladik\nBrad Casey\nCason Sharpe)\nE.

Few of its current inhabitants know that Toronto has seen twelve thousand years of uninterrupted Indigenous presence and nationhood in this region, along with a vibrant culture and history that thrives to this day.\nWith contributions by Indigenous Elders, scholars, journalists, artists, and historians, this unique anthology explores the poles of cultural continuity and settler colonialism that have come to define Toronto as a significant cultural hub and intersection that was also known as a Meeting Place long before European settlers arrived.\nContributors include political scientist Hayden King, artist and curator Wanda Nanibush, chef Johl Whiteduck Ringuette, poet and broadcaster Duke Redbird, playwright Drew Hayden Taylor, educator Kerry Potts, writer\/journalist Miles Morrisseau, dancer and scholar Karen Pheasant-Neganigwane, and photographer Nadya Kwandibens.\nPre-order Indigenous Toronto here!\nThis event will be hosted in Zoom Webinars. The event link will be sent over email one hour before the start of the event."

Every single day poet and educator Shanice Nicole is reminded of how special Black girls are and of how lucky she is to be one. Illustrations by Kezna Dalz support the book\u2019s message that no two Black girls are the same but they are all special\u2014that to be a Black girl is a true gift. In this celebratory poem, Kezna and Shanice remind young readers that despite differences, they all deserve to be loved just the way they are.\n\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\nSHANICE NICOLE is a Black feminist educator, facilitator, writer, and (out)spoken word artist. She believes that everyone has the power to make change and dreams of a freer world for us all. Learn more about her work at shanicenicole.com.\nKEZNA DALZ is a multidisciplinary Black artist from Montreal. She cares about representation, and portrays the beauty of womanhood, teenadult angst, and the worst of pop culture using vibrant colours. You can find more of her work at teenadultt.com.\nMAGUY M\u00c9TELLUS is a Haitiano-Quebecoise mother, grandmother, militante afrof\u00e9ministe, human rights advocate, diseuse and animatrice. In May 2016 she co-founded the Lectures Logos Readings with H. Nigel Thomas and the late Horace I. Goddard. Over the past twenty years she has become a staple in the community. She now revels in her new status as a beloved elder.\nDaughter of parents from small Caribbean islands who, in Canada, became activists by circumstance, NANTALI INDONGO follows those natural instincts; carrying the torch into classrooms and communities, into studios and onto stages, with master's tools and microphones; exposing to educate, rhyming to rouse. All of that, so that the top tips over and humbles itself; the bottom sees the booby traps and makes an educated move.\nAs an artist, for the last 16 years, Nantali found her voice as Tali Taliwah, one of the emcees - vocalists in Montreal hip hop band Nomadic Massive. Touring Canada and the world, Tali loves to celebrate not only hip hop culture, but especially Caribbean musical cultures through some of her rhymes and vocal styles.\nThe life of the artist on stage was coupled with life as an artivist, for 10 years, sharing an educational and interactive workshop series that looks at the non-violent origins of Hip Hop culture. \u201cHip Hop No Pop\u201d series that she co-created with founder and filmmaker, Maryse Legagneur, brought Nantali into communities and schools, specifically across Canada, to the US, to Haiti, Democratic Republic of Congo and Australia.\nAs an informal educator, broadcaster or performer, Nantali is a storyteller. Her sense of purpose: to push conversations forward to a place where positive inspiration becomes positive action.\nHer 7 year old son is her spiritual healer."
